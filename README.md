# Week 4 Python Assignment – File & Exception Handling

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates **file handling** and **exception handling** concepts in Python.  
The program is menu-driven and performs the following tasks:

1. **Task 1 – Create and Read Students**  
   - Creates a file called `students.txt` with student names.  
   - Reads and displays the names.  

2. **Task 2 – Add Marks**  
   - Creates a file called `marks.txt` with random marks (60–100).  
   - Reads and displays the marks.  

3. **Task 3 – Display Results**  
   - Combines names and marks into a `results.txt` file.  
   - Displays results in the format:  
     ```
     Alice - 85
     Bob - 92
     Charlie - 78
     ```

4. **Task 4 – Exception Handling Demo**  
   - Demonstrates how `FileNotFoundError` is handled when trying to open a non-existing file.

5. **Exit Option**  
   - Cleanly exits the program with a waving goodbye animation 👋.
